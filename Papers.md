""" The proposed machine learning-based system for gold price prediction has demonstrated
significant potential in providing accurate and reliable forecasts. By leveraging advanced
machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines,
Artificial Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory models, the system was able to
predict future gold prices with impressive accuracy. Among the models tested, XGBoost and
Random Forest emerged as the most robust and effective, providing high RÂ² values and low
prediction errors, making them suitable for real-world financial applications.
